TiledLib
========

About
-----
TiledLib is a C# library for utilizing the Tiled map editor for use in a game made with XNA Game Studio 4.0. With the latest version (from 12/2/2011), the library is now targeted entirely to the parsing of the Tiled .TMX files as a Content Importer. This means that your game needs to create an appropriate processor to take the data provided and turn it into the correct types for your specific game.
